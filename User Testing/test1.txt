User 1:

Initial reaction:
	was unsure where to click for save vs. load
	didn't know rules of game with board of size 4
	didn't see response for when game was saved so was unsure if game saved or not
	once rules were told verbally test went smoothly
changes to implement:
	make it clear where to click on initialization screen
	give user response on saved game
	(display rules somewhere?)
